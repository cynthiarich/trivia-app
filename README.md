# Pub Trivia App

## Overview

In these days of families and friends being spread out across wide geographical locations, and even more in our current coronavirus crisis, it is sometimes hard to be able to get together to share some fun. This is where our app comes in. We are creating a virtual pub quiz (bring your own beer!) where you can login and invite friends and family to join you for a quiz! You play against each other in real time, and watch your avatars race each other to be the winner. After the quiz your friends might want to sign up too and create a group, so you can keep competing again and again. When you're done playing why not contribute a question yourself to bamboozle someone else. 

## Research
### Real Value to People
Not all families and friends live near each other. Family members move away for work or school, or friends who meet at college disperse around the world after they have graduated, but they still want to keep in contact and do something together. Cat's family lives in the USA, UK, Canada and Ireland and love to do quizzes... but there has to be a better way than sending telegram group messages!

These other apps and websites mainly give you the question with no ability to add your own, and no recurring group aspect.
